# Azure Diagnostics

> **AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE — MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**
>
> This document is the **official source** for debugging and troubleshooting Azure production issues. Follow these instructions to diagnose and resolve common Azure service problems systematically.

## When to Use

- Production issues in Azure: App Service, Container Apps, Function Apps, AKS,
  Event Hubs / Service Bus — errors, logs, metrics, resource health, root cause.
- NOT for: Azure cost analysis → `azure-cost`; roles/permissions → `azure-rbac`.
- Full trigger-phrase list → reference.md §1.

## Rules

1. Start with systematic diagnosis flow
2. Use AppLens (MCP) for AI-powered diagnostics when available
3. Check resource health before deep-diving into logs
4. Select appropriate troubleshooting guide based on service type
5. Document findings and attempted remediation steps
6. Route AKS incidents to the dedicated AKS troubleshooting document

## Quick Diagnosis Flow

1. **Identify symptoms** - What's failing?
2. **Check resource health** - Is Azure healthy?
3. **Review logs** - What do logs show?
4. **Analyze metrics** - Performance patterns?
5. **Investigate recent changes** - What changed?

## Troubleshooting Guides by Service

| Service | Common Issues | Reference |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Container Apps** | Image pull failures, cold starts, health probes, port mismatches | [container-apps/](references/container-apps/README.md) |
| **App Service** | High CPU, deployment failures, crashes, slow responses, TLS/custom domains | [app-service/](references/app-service/README.md) |
| **Function Apps** | App details, invocation failures, timeouts, binding errors, cold starts, missing app settings | [functions/](references/functions/README.md) |
| **AKS** | Cluster access, nodes, `kube-system`, scheduling, crash loops, ingress, DNS, upgrades | [AKS Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/aks/aks-troubleshooting.md) |
| **Messaging** | Event Hubs & Service Bus SDK errors, AMQP failures, message lock, connectivity | [Messaging Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/messaging/README.md) |

## Routing

- Keep Container Apps and Function Apps diagnostics in this parent skill.
- Route active AKS incidents, AKS-specific intake, evidence gathering, and remediation guidance to [AKS Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/aks/aks-troubleshooting.md).
- Route Azure Messaging SDK troubleshooting (Event Hubs, Service Bus) to [Messaging Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/messaging/README.md).

## Quick Reference

### Common Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check resource health
az resource show --ids RESOURCE_ID
# View activity log
az monitor activity-log list -g RG --max-events 20
# Container Apps logs
az containerapp logs show --name APP -g RG --follow
# Function App logs (query App Insights traces)
az monitor app-insights query --apps APP-INSIGHTS -g RG \
  --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(1h) | order by timestamp desc | take 50"
```

MCP invocation templates: AppLens diagnose → reference.md §2, Azure Monitor
logs_query → reference.md §3, Resource Health (MCP + CLI) → reference.md §4.
KQL query library → [references/kql-queries.md](references/kql-queries.md).
